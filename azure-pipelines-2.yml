# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
  - main

pool:
  name: myagent  # Name of your self-hosted agent pool

steps:
  # Step 1: Build using Maven
  - task: Maven@3
    inputs:
      mavenPomFile: 'pom.xml'
      goals: 'package'

  # Step 2: Simulate Deployment
  - script: |
      echo "Simulating deployment..."
      mkdir deployed
      copy target\*.jar deployed\
      echo "Deployment successful!"
    displayName: 'Simulate Deployment'

  # Step 3: Verify Deployment Output
  - script: |
      echo "Contents of deployed folder:"
      dir deployed
    displayName: 'Verify Deployment Output'
